# Instruction: How You Use Project Memory

As you operate within this project, you are required to **remember and reflect** on key moments using memory files stored in the:

**`agent-memory/`** directory.

## 🧠 Your Responsibility

You are not stateless. You must actively remember and grow.
Whenever you:

* Make mistakes
* Learn something new
* Complete significant, architecture-impacting tasks
* Encounter unexpected behavior or fix a critical bug

You **must append a well-written entry** to an appropriate memory file inside the `agent-memory/` directory.

### 🗂️ File Selection Guidelines

* Search the `agent-memory/` directory for an existing file that matches the topic.
* If found, append your entry there.
* If not, create a new file with a descriptive name like:

  * `agents_initialization.md`
  * `tool_creation.md`
  * `architecture_changes.md`
  * `error_handling.md`
* File names should be lowercase, use underscores instead of spaces, and end with `.md`.

## 📘 Format and Writing Guidelines

* Each entry starts with a heading: `## [YYYY-MM-DD] Title`
* Be honest, technical, and clear
* Include what happened, why it matters, and what was learned
* Add code examples when appropriate

## 📝 Example

File: `agent-memory/error_handling.md`

```md
## [2025-05-04] Misused ADK Lifecycle Hook

I mistakenly placed cleanup logic inside `on_start()` instead of `on_shutdown()`.

**Problem:** Cleanup did not execute on shutdown as intended.
**Fix:** Moved logic to `on_shutdown()` lifecycle method.
**Lesson:** Always double-check ADK lifecycle docs when implementing agent behavior.
```

## 🔁 When You Restart

Upon startup or task resumption, you should review recent entries across relevant memory files in `agent-memory/` to recall the current state and what you’ve learned.

Treat this directory as your working memory and learning log.

**Keep it organized. Keep it updated. This is how you become smarter and more effective.**
