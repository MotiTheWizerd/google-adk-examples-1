## [2024-06-12] Handling ADK Function Calls and Response Flow

Investigated an issue where an agent chain stopped prematurely after executing a tool function (`add_reminder`). The root causes involved incorrect handling of function call parameters and a broken asynchronous response processing flow.

**Problem:** The agent interaction terminated immediately after the `add_reminder` tool was called. Key issues identified:

1.  **Parameter Structure Mismatch:** The ADK framework passed arguments nested within a `parameters` key (`{"parameters": {"reminder": "..."}}`), but the `add_reminder` function expected the `reminder` argument at the top level of the dictionary.
2.  **Broken Response Chain:** The response processing logic in `utils/llm/call_agent_async.py` did not correctly return the final textual response or handle intermediate events properly. The `process_agent_response` function didn't consistently return values, and the calling loop in `call_agent_async` didn't effectively wait for and capture the final agent message after the tool call completed.

**Fix:**

1.  Modified the `add_reminder` function in `main.py` to check if the arguments are nested within a `parameters` key and extract them accordingly before processing.
2.  Refactored the `process_agent_response` function in `utils/llm/call_agent_async.py` to return the final text message when `event.is_final_response()` is true, and the `event` object otherwise.
3.  Updated the loop in `call_agent_async` to correctly process each event using the modified `process_agent_response` and store the result when it's the final response, ensuring the loop completes and returns the actual agent message.
4.  Improved the agent's instruction in `main.py` to explicitly request confirmation after the tool use, guiding the agent's behavior post-execution.

**Lesson:** When implementing tools within the Google ADK framework:

- Be aware that function call arguments might be passed in a nested `parameters` structure. Tool functions must anticipate and handle this.
- Asynchronous response handling logic (`runner.run_async` loop) must correctly process and return both intermediate events and the final response message to ensure the agent chain continues after tool execution. Simply processing the event without returning appropriate values can break the flow.
- Agent instructions should clearly define expected behavior _after_ tool use (e.g., confirmation messages) to ensure a smooth conversational flow.
- Debugging ADK interactions, especially around tool calls, often requires consulting the ADK source code (`adk/` directory) to understand the internal handling of parameters and event flows (e.g., `handle_function_calls_async`).
