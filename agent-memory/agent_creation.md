\n## [2024-07-24] Created Python Expert Agent\n\nCreated a new agent named `PythonExpertAgent` designed to act as a senior Python developer. This agent takes user requests for Python code and returns the generated code within a structured JSON output.\n\n**Files Created:**\n* `agents/python_expert_agent/__init__.py` (empty)\n* `agents/python_expert_agent/python_expert_agent.py` (contains factory function `get_python_expert_agent`)\n* `prompts/python_expert_agent_prompt.py` (contains the detailed prompt instructing the agent on its role and JSON output format: `{\"code\": \"<generated_code_goes_here>\"}`)\n\n**Agent Configuration:**\n* **Name:** `PythonExpertAgent`\n* **Description:** A senior expert Python developer agent that takes user requests and provides Python code solutions in JSON format.\n* **Model:** `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`\n* **Prompt:** Defined in `prompts/python_expert_agent_prompt.py`, which includes specific instructions for JSON output and handling of special characters within the code string.\n* **Input Expectation:** The prompt template includes a `{request}` placeholder for the user's query.\n\n**Lesson:** Followed the `HOW_TO_CREATE_AN_AGENT.md` guide to structure the new agent. Ensured the prompt clearly dictates the required JSON output format to the LLM, including examples. Selected a powerful model (`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`) suitable for code generation tasks. The agent is self-contained and can be integrated using its factory function.
