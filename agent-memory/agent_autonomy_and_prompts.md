## [2024-07-30] Enforcing Agent Autonomy via Prompt Engineering

Modified agent prompts to ensure `network_system_agent` and `system_info_agent` operate autonomously without asking for additional information.

**Problem:** Agents might attempt to solicit more data if their tools don't cover every possible detail, but the requirement is for them to perform their analysis based solely on what their tools can gather.

**Fix:**
Updated the instructional prompts in:

- `prompts/network_system_agent_prompt.py`
- `prompts/system_info_agent_prompt.py`

The key modifications include adding explicit directives such as:

- "Based _solely_ on the data provided by your tools..."
- "Look for any error messages, missing data, or notes reported by the tool during data collection and clearly mention these limitations in your analysis. **Do not ask for missing information.**"
- "If errors occurred during data gathering...mention these limitations in the analysis and make recommendations based on the information that _was_ successfully retrieved. **Do not request the missing data.**"
- A concluding **Important** section was added to both prompts, emphasizing: "You must perform your analysis and generate recommendations autonomously using only the data gathered by your tools. If some information is unavailable or an error occurs during tool execution, report this as a limitation and proceed with the analysis based on the remaining data. Do not ask clarifying questions or request additional information."

**Lesson:** To achieve truly autonomous agent behavior, especially regarding information gathering, their core instructional prompts must be very specific about how to handle incomplete data or tool errors. Instead of halting or asking for help, they should be instructed to report these as limitations and proceed with the analysis based on the successfully retrieved information. This makes agent operation more predictable and aligns with a no-intervention requirement.
